### 2. Introduction to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing

#### üìä Overview of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq Technology

10x Genomics Chromium platform enables **high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)**. 
It captures thousands to tens of thousands of individual cells per run, isolating and barcoding transcripts from each cell.

**Key Concepts:**

- üß¨ ** Cell Barcodes:** Identify which cell each transcript came from.
- üîÅ ** UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifiers):** Help quantify gene expression by correcting for PCR duplicates.
- üéØ Supports both **3' and 5' gene expression profiling**.

1. **Sample Preparation:** Generate a single-cell suspension from tissue or culture.
2. **Chromium Partitioning:** Cells are encapsulated in droplets with barcoded beads.
3. **Reverse Transcription:** Transcripts are barcoded and converted to cDNA inside droplets.

### 4. **Cell Ranger Overview for Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Pre-processing**

To initiate single-cell RNA-seq data analysis using the 10x Genomics platform, raw sequencing data 
must first be processed with **Cell Ranger**, a comprehensive software suite developed by 10x Genomics, 
available at [https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads).

To run Cell Ranger successfully, 
both the **software** and the appropriate **reference genome** must be installed on your system.
After installing Cell Ranger, users must also download the appropriate **reference transcriptome package**, 
which is essential for aligning reads and assigning them to annotated genes. 

- For step-by-step instructions on installing **installing Cell Ranger**, see the **[installation guide (01-cellranger-installation.md)](./docs/01-cellranger-installation.md)**.
- For guidance on **downloading and configuring reference genome files**, refer to the **[reference genome setup guide (02-cellranger-refGenome.md)](./docs/02-cellranger-refGenome.md)**.

Additionally, cell Ranger offers a collection of tools designed for various stages of data processing and analysis:

- **`cellranger mkfastq`** ‚Äì Converts raw Illumina BCL files into sample-specific FASTQ files.
- **`cellranger count`** ‚Äì Performs read alignment, barcode and UMI filtering, and quantifies gene expression to generate the gene-barcode matrix for individual samples.
- **`cellranger aggr`** ‚Äì Aggregates multiple `count` outputs into a single dataset, normalizing for sequencing depth across samples.
- **`cellranger vdj`** ‚Äì Assembles full-length T-cell receptor (TCR) or B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences from 5‚Ä≤ immune profiling libraries.
- **`cellranger reanalyze`** ‚Äì Conducts secondary analyses such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene filtering on existing `count` data.
- **`cellranger targeted-compare`** ‚Äì Compares results from targeted gene expression libraries against whole transcriptome datasets.

In this workflow, we primarily focus on **`cellranger count`**, which serves as 
the foundational step for converting raw sequencing reads into interpretable, cell-level gene expression matrices 
used in downstream analyses such as clustering, differential expression, and cell type annotation. 
For a step-by-step walkthrough of running **`cellranger count`**, visit the **[execution guide](./docs/03-cellranger-count.md)**.

### 5. **Seurat Object Construction and Quality Control from Cell Ranger Outputs**  

After processing raw sequencing data using the `cellranger count` pipeline, 
the resulting filtered feature-barcode matrix can be imported into R using the **Seurat** package 
to construct Seurat objects for downstream single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

This section covers the following key steps:

1. Building a Seurat object from Cell Ranger outputs
2. Calculating mitochondrial gene content
3. Filtering low-quality cells based on gene and UMI thresholds
4. Visualizing quality control metrics

The detailed execution guide for these steps is provided in this [processing document](./docs/04-qc-seurat.md).

### 6. **Detecting Doublets with DoubletDecon** 

Doublets or multiplets‚Äîinstances where two or more cells are captured within a single droplet‚Äîcan confound 
single-cell RNA-seq analysis by producing hybrid gene expression profiles. 
Detecting and removing these artifacts is essential for ensuring the accuracy of downstream analyses 
such as clustering, differential expression, and lineage inference.

This section demonstrates how to use the **DoubletDecon** R package to 
identify and filter doublets through both **centroid** and **medoid-based** detection strategies. 
The results from both methods can be used to update the Seurat object by adding a doublet metadata 
column and subsetting only the high-confidence singlet cells for further analysis.

The execution code for this step is detailed in the [05-doublets.md](./docs/05-doublets.md) file.

### 7. **Seurat Object Normalization and Multi-Sample Integration**  

After performing initial filtering and quality control on each sample, 
the next step is to normalize the gene expression data and prepare for integration across multiple samples. 
This ensures that biological signals are retained while minimizing batch effects or technical variation between samples.

This section describes two main processes:
1. **Normalization and Feature Selection** for individual samples using Seurat‚Äôs standard single-cell analysis pipeline.
2. **Integration of Multiple Samples** using anchor-based integration, which aligns shared cell types across datasets.

These steps enable downstream analyses such as clustering, differential expression, 
and trajectory inference across combined datasets. The execution code is accessible at [06-normalization-integration.md](./docs/06-normalization-integration.md)


### 8. **Clustering and Cell Type Identification**  

Following data integration, the next phase involves unsupervised clustering 
to group cells with similar gene expression patterns. This step is critical for 
identifying distinct cell populations and forms the basis for downstream tasks 
such as marker gene analysis and cell type annotation.

In this section, we will:

1. Scale the integrated Seurat object to standardize expression values
2. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
3. Construct a shared nearest neighbor graph and perform clustering
4. Visualize the identified clusters using UMAP and t-SNE

The complete execution steps and code can be found in the [07-clustering.md](./docs/07-clustering.md) document.


### 9. **Visualization with UMAP/TSNE**  
   + Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into two dimensions for visual interpretation


After clustering, visualizing high-dimensional single-cell RNA-seq data in two dimensions 
helps to intuitively interpret cellular heterogeneity and population structure. 
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) 
are two commonly used nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques for this purpose. 
They project cells into a 2D space based on their gene expression profiles, 
allowing easy identification of distinct clusters, gradients, and outliers. 
This section demonstrates how to generate UMAP and t-SNE plots to aid in exploratory data analysis and presentation.  

The corresponding code for this step is provided in [08-umap.md](./docs/08-umap.md).

### 10. **Differential Expression Analysis**  

Differential expression (DE) analysis allows for the identification of genes 
that are differentially expressed between clusters, experimental conditions, or cell types. 
This step is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms that differentiate cell populations and 
for identifying marker genes associated with specific biological states. 
By comparing gene expression across clusters or conditions, DE analysis helps reveal key biomarkers, 
pathways, and cellular functions of interest. 

The execution code for performing DE analysis is available at [09-de-analysis.md](./docs/09-de-analysis.md), 
which guides you through identifying marker genes and performing comparisons across different groups in your dataset.
